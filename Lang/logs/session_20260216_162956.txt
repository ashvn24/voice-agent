=== Vidur AI Session — 2026-02-16 16:29 ===

[16:30:10] Vidur: Hey! I'm Vidur, your counseling buddy. What's your name?

[16:30:41] Student: hi my name is Ashwin

[16:31:05] Vidur: Hey Ashwin, thanks for talking to me. How's your day been so far? Anything on your mind that you wanted to share with someone?

[16:31:30] Student: I would like to learn about LangChain architecture

[16:31:36] Vidur: LangChain can be a complex topic. Can you tell me what specifically within LangChain is giving you trouble or what you're hoping to understand better?

[16:32:00] Student: have no prior experience to it so I would like to learn from scratch

[16:32:07] Vidur: That's totally fine, Ashwin! Starting from the beginning makes sense then. What do you know about chain-based architectures in general? Have you worked with any similar concepts before?
